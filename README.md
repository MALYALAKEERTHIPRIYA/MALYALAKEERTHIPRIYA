# Keerthipriya Malyala

I am a computer science student focused on building strong foundations before chasing complexity.

My interest in programming comes from curiosity — understanding how systems work, why they fail, and how they can be improved. I value depth over speed and consistency over short bursts of motivation.

## Current Focus

- Strengthening Java and core problem-solving skills  
- Practicing Data Structures and Algorithms daily  
- Learning Machine Learning through implementation  
- Building full-stack projects that solve practical problems  

## How I Approach Learning

I prefer clarity over shortcuts.  
I revisit fundamentals until they feel natural.  
I build projects not just to complete them, but to understand them.

Growth, to me, is not loud.  
It is structured, deliberate, and continuous.

## Direction

My goal is to become an engineer who:
- Thinks from first principles  
- Writes clean, understandable code  
- Can design systems with confidence  

This profile is not a finished story.  
It is a record of progress.
